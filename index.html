        <h1> Run to the Hills</h1>
        <p>White man came across the sea<br>
            He brought us pain and misery<br>
            He killed our tribes, he killed our creed<br>
            He took our game for his own need<br>
        </p>
        <p>We fought him hard, we fought him well<br>
            Out on the plains, we gave him hell<br>
            But many came, too much for Cree<br>
            Oh, will we ever be set free?
        </p>
        <p> Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes<br>
            Galloping hard on the plains<br>
            Chasing the redskins back to their holes<br>
            Fighting them at their own game<br>
            Murder for freedom, the stab in the back<br>
            Women and children and cowards attack
        </p>
        <p>Run to the hills<br>
           Run for your lives<br>
           Run to the hills<br>
           Run for your lives<br>
        </p>
    </body>
